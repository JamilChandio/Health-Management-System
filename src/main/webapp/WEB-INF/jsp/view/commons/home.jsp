		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>I've developed a Health Management System project for
			educational purposes, utilizing Java EE, JDBC, core Java concepts,
			JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, Ajax, jQuery, and HTML. This project
			serves as a practical exercise to enhance my skills and understanding
			of web development technologies. The system comprises three main
			modules: Admin, Doctor, and Patient. Through diligent implementation
			of design patterns and proper exception handling, I've ensured the
			project's stability and maintainability. Within the Admin module,
			I've included functionalities for managing patient and doctor
			profiles, along with basic CRUD operations for medical records.
			Doctors have access to profile updates and appointment management
			features, allowing for smooth scheduling and patient interaction. For
			patients, the system provides a user-friendly interface to view
			medical records, update personal information, schedule appointments,
			and monitor appointment statuses. With a MySQL database backend, the
			project maintains data security and integrity throughout. In
			conclusion, this Health Management System project serves as a
			valuable learning experience, offering practical insights into web
			development techniques and principles.</p>
